This pseudo-code outlines the structure and core functions of a simple file system. Each subroutine and function would need to be fleshed out with the specific logic for handling the underlying storage medium and the Propeller 2's capabilities. The error handling, memory management, and optimization for performance are not detailed here and would need to be considered during the actual implementation.
