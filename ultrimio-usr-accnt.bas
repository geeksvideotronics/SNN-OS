REM Data Structures for permiting multiple users:

' Basic user record (store securely!)
TYPE User
  ID AS INTEGER
  Username AS STRING * 10
  Password AS STRING * 10 ' Placeholder (don't store plain text passwords)
  Active AS BOOLEAN
  CurrentNode AS INTEGER
END TYPE

' User group (limited permissions example)
TYPE Group
  ID AS INTEGER
  Name AS STRING * 10
  Read AS BOOLEAN
  Write AS BOOLEAN
END TYPE

' Global arrays (adjust sizes as needed)
DIM Users(10) AS User
DIM Groups(3) AS Group
Account Management Functions:

' Basic create user (secure storage required)
SUB CreateUser(username AS STRING)
  FOR i = 0 TO 9
    IF Users(i).ID = 0 THEN
      Users(i).ID = i + 1
      Users(i).Username = username
      ' Store other data securely elsewhere (e.g., external EEPROM)
      RETURN
    END IF
  NEXT i
  ' Handle no available slots scenario
END SUB

' Simple login attempt (implement real password hashing/comparison)
SUB Login(username AS STRING, password AS STRING) AS INTEGER
  FOR i = 0 TO 9
    IF Users(i).Username = username AND password = "admin" THEN ' Replace with secure check
      Users(i).Active = TRUE
      RETURN i ' Return user ID
    END IF
  NEXT i
  RETURN -1 ' Login failed
END SUB

' Basic permission check (expand based on your needs)
FUNCTION HasPermission(userID AS INTEGER, permission AS INTEGER) AS BOOLEAN
  IF Groups(Users(userID).Group).Read = TRUE AND permission = 0 THEN RETURN TRUE
  IF Groups(Users(userID).Group).Write = TRUE AND permission = 1 THEN RETURN TRUE
  RETURN FALSE
END FUNCTION
Retro-Futuristic Elements:

' Basic login screen display (replace with visual effects)
SUB ShowLoginScreen()
  PRINT "# Login #"
  PRINT "Username: "
  INPUT username
  PRINT "Password: "
  INPUT password
  user = Login(username, password)
  IF user < 0 THEN PRINT "Access Denied!" ELSE PRINT "Welcome " & Users(user).Username
END SUB

' Simple permission management (replace with visual interface)
SUB ManagePermissions(userID AS INTEGER)
  group = Users(userID).Group
  PRINT "Read: " & Groups(group).Read
  PRINT "Write: " & Groups(group).Write
  IF Input$() = "1" THEN Groups(group).Read = NOT Groups(group).Read
  IF Input$() = "2" THEN Groups(group).Write = NOT Groups(group).Write
END SUB
Remember:

REM Replace with secure practices (password hashing, external storage, access control).
